# TailwindCSS training

## Description

Okay. While trying to make my own portfolio page I realized that my CSS skills were horrible and the little I knew about CSS had been forgotten. I also realized that making a portfolio page without a good vision only results in no good page at all. Thus I have to go to the basics by cloning some already existing pages and learn more about styling, page structure and design. At the same time this will create some more content on my portfolio site once I get it finished.

I know that using Typescript and React might be a bit overkill in this project but I wanted to use them anyway in order to get more familiar with them.
